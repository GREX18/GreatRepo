### Interest of Content
Wide range of topics covered

### Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
The formatting is consistent and nice, barring tha traumatising image (you know the one)

### Quality of Written Presentation
The content can be lacking in some places, but the quality of writing is good

### Validity of HTML

Generally, HTML syntax is correct and valid. As commented one page doesn't close its body tag. Also, some pages may benefit from better indentation to improve readability. 

### Evidence of Collaboration

All pages apart from medicine and the index have author details. It is obvious the style has been created collaboratively.
